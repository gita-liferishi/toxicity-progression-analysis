103587368.2032.2010,1169897341.0, I'm trying to format wiki_link into multiple columns (3 columns) due to the size of the list - there are currently several screens full of nothing but long a long scrolling list of citations. I tried using wiki_link but it doesn't render in 3 columns in my browser (or the majority of browsers). Are there any other alternatives I can use to make the references appear in 2 or 3 columns or to otherwise drastically reduce the screen estate taken up by the citations?

Another site could serve only articles composed of edits approved by a board of editors whose particular editorial style you like. Yet another site could serve edits based on mass moderation. And yet another site (say, wikipedia.org) could allow you to select from all the available edits to an article in order to tailor the article which meets your exact quality demands.

The debate we are trying to have here is not really about who has 'control' over it, but the naming in the Arabic language. Indeed, الخليج العربي is what it is called and has been called for a long time. As for the actual gulf itself, it isn't controlled or owned by one of the two sides. And for some of the editors here who are vehemently defending the naming الخليج الفارسي without proper sources, or even proper justification, please stop. There is no reason to start a lame edit war over something like this, the title of the article should follow what it is commonly referred to in English, since this is English wikipedia, but whether you like it or not, the fact is that in Arabic it is called 'The Arabic Gulf'.

Besides, look at the map, you will see that it the gulf is bordered roughly equally by Arab countries and by Iran. If you go to an Arab country and ask an Arab what this gulf is called, chances are they will say الخليج العربي.

I have already explained that in classical Arabic it is also Khalij Farsi.   So the minority POV (in the western world and this is english wikipedia) should not be given the same weight.  The reason that Iranians get upset over this issue is simple.  From the Hadeeths of the Prophet Muhammad till 50 years in  Arabic texts it has been Bahr-e-Fars, Khalij-e-Farsi.. but all of the sudden Nasser/Saddam.. come and change it to Khalij 'Arabi in Arabic speaking countries.  The reason is simple.  Two groups of people Arab countries do not like are Persians and Jews.  Persians/Iranians despite being Muslims are disliked in Arab countries and that is why Nasser/Saddam changed the historical name.  I am wondering if you would like it if someone calledSaudia Arabia as America or Persia?  Personally I find this political manipulation racist as calling Saudia Arabia as Persia.  There is also an ''Arabian sea'' in the Indian ocean and an ''Arabian Gulf'' in western literature used for the Red Sea.  Thus the Arabic countries should fix their mistake with this regard and not try to propogate it.  Note the historical revisionism with this regard. [].  Interestingly enough they say Israel should be called فلسطین and Israel is a new name.  Assuming that to be the case (and I am no expert on that issue), then why the double standard?

It does not negate the fact that Arab countries call it Arabian Gulf which is discussed later in the article as a minority POV can not be presented on the first line.  But if there is confusion we can simply remove the Arabic in the first line.   Nevertheless we have mentioned that Arab countries call it Arabian Gulf later in the article.  Unlike the Arabian Gulf which has never been found in any Arabian text..the name Israel is mentioned by Jews .

You have a researcher with a decade of research on prostitution who is now characterized as having opinions about ""sex work"" which, as far as I can tell, is a quite vague and unscientific term that she doesn't even use.

I removed the image because it is unencyclopaedic, uninformative and may even violate NPOV. I object to you calling it vandalism simply because it was your image, and I would ask you to follow the guidelines outlined in wiki_link before you accuse anybody of vandalism. Should you need some clarification about the differences, you can always consult an administrator at the wiki_link. Next, I saw your message about blanking my talk page. I also object to this, since the removal of that information was outdated and, again, irrelevant. The incident in question had been resolved, in my favor, so I didn't see the necessity in maintaining that information on that page. You yourself have blanked several notices on this page about images you had that were considered for deletion, with your only explanation being ""whatever.""

*external_link from the Political Science Institute of Bordeaux and the USC in LA is called ""Towards an Americanization of French Metropolitan Areas ?"" and deals with the ""aires urbaines"" as specifically stated in their introduction.
*external_link by the labour department of the European Union specifically says this: ""Population of the metropolitan area (aire urbaine) is 1,140,000.""
*external_link from the Canadian Journal of Regional Science translates its French title ""Forme urbaine et mobilité  une application à l'aire urbaine de Bordeaux"" as ""Urban Form and Travel Patterns. An application to the metropolitan area of Bordeaux"" in English.
*external_link from the Grenoble district of the French Ministry of Education, we find the following sentence in the introdution: ""Thématique Réaliser une carte sur les aires urbaines ("" Metropolitan Area "") supérieures à 500.000 habitants de la périphérie des Etats Unis ."" Note that this paper is destined to geography teachers in the high schools of the Grenoble region.

I am sorry. The fact is that I went to ADHD testing in September, where it was determined that (A) I don't have ADHD, (B) I do, however, have a very strong negative reaction to amphetamines, such as those used in the testing. You can see why I've been far more scatterbrained than usual this fall. Not exactly how a fresh admin should behave. Happily, I'll be going on vacation as well shortly and hope to sane up during that time.
Now, as for the referencing, anything you would add would be great. The book is the best thing we have - pretty much the only reference that specifically contrasts Jurassic Park and reality. I gather it's primarily about the recreation process? Well, our coverage of specific dinosaurs is pretty good, or at least fixable, what would be of particular interest are hard facts about dino cloning (a simple ""DeSalle and Lindley state this to be impossible for the foreseeable futurereference"" would be valuable - at the moment the section's mostly random facts) and unrelated biological issues, such as pathogens, the needed land area and those kinds of things, they are practically not covered at all.

The only reports of Ms. Lewis' life are negative - associated with a single incident. We are not YouTube and we are not blogs. Wikipedia does not allow a single incident to define a minor figure's life. Unless we can create a balanced biography which reports on someone's life neutrally and is not entirely about a single, apparently negative, incident, then we don't write them at all. That's established policy at wiki_link.
Where a person is mentioned by name in a Wikipedia article about a larger subject, but remains of essentially low profile themselves, we should generally avoid having an article on them. If reliable sources only cover the person in the context of a particular event, then a separate biography is unlikely to be warranted.
Otherwise, what we end up with is this person being defined by this single incident on Wikipedia, forever. That's not what we're about.

170137009.54540.54540,1194544852.0," This has all been argued at length before, through arbitrations and mediations and talk page discussions. These lists are comparable to those in other event articles, far shorter than some, and do not include external links to websites of the artists, so they are not linkfarms. They are not unencyclopedic, as they do add to the notability of the event, and the lists only include acts/speakers notable enough to have their own Wikipedia articles. Asking to prove either that their inclusion is important to the event or that the event is important to them is asking for a ridiculous amount of tail-chasing that makes no more sense than asking the same for the yearly line-ups on Lalapaloosa's stages, and would only be a bunch of subjective frillery. These are no less encyclopedic for an event than a list of albums appeared on is for a musician, or a list of venues performed at, or magazines a writer's work has appeared in.

170138856.54888.54888,1194545409.0,"Here is a copy of part of that discussion: * '''Comment''' Lists such as these, and even more extensive ones, are common on festival articles. IMO, there is nothing ""unencyclopedic"" about them. On the contrary, they are an important component to an event that books speakers and/or entertainers. Also, the term ""wiki_link"" does not apply at all to these lists, as reading the Listcruft article makes clear. They are obviously relevent and notable to the subject of the article, and should not be broken out for their own article. They are not indiscriminate, but include only people notable enough in their own right to have articles. They are shorter than many lists in articles about other festivals, non-repetitious, and do not include external links to commercial websites. This material would certainly be of interest to anyone interested in checking out an article on the Starwood Festival. Here is a partial list of other festivals' articles that have lists of acts (or contest winners, or whatever relevent term there is for the kind of festival it is). They are of all kinds of festivals. I see no justification for calling the lists on Starwood Festival or WinterStar Symposium ""listcruft"" or laundry lists, terms generally used to indicate articles SOLELY consisting of a list of something with neither context nor an indicated group to which it would be of interest. *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link of Blues and Progressive Music (1970) *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link *wiki_link In my opinion, incorporating names into a paragraph of text is more unweildy, and harder to reference for a reader. Examples of this can be seen at wiki_link and wiki_link. I think simple, non-repetitive lists of relevent material are perfectly acceptable, and these lists qualify. :: Kathryn NicDhàna (Talk | contribs), who has been involved in this issue before, has returned the tag with the statement ""Actually, no, it's a legitimate concern"". I don't see the ""concern"". These lists don't take away from the articles; in fact, they contribute to them. ::: Kathryn NicDhàna now posts: ""Publications in ""References"" does not indicate if they are non-trivial mentions that source content."" I am not aware of ANY article that includes characterizations of just how significant or trivial a particular reference might be, or on what scale one would measure that, or where you would put such a characterization. She also says that the article has no ""footnotes"", though it clearly has ""Notes"", and plenty of references, and no article is REQUIRED to have footnotes. She also says it ""reads like an advert"", even though it contains only descriptions of elements of the event and it's history with no value judgements, encouragement to attend, or info about upcoming programming.

For your other reference (Resulovic) I was clear before ('''read above'''), otherwise I can use my friend that is sitting here close to me as a source and yes he really has published something and if he drinks will think that he is academic (It was a joke though:)). No regrets and still waiting. Best regards And by the way, why you DO NOT USE the books written about Albanian history in order to partecipate in the writings of Albanian history on Wikipedia? You use only one book as a reference and furthermore this book is about Greece?! Don't you think that one source is not good enough? There are plenty of books about Albanian history in English.

179753910.3415.3415,1198399128.0," What the issue is in Paw-20 article wiki_link is that over several edits you changed it in this manner   However, you didn't provide any citations for those changes, such as an industry website, a newspaper article, a corporate PR release, a patent document, etc, that attribute it to Tony Neophytou of Neopup PTY LTD.  On the other hand, using google, I was able to source it to the original Gemaco Elbree Pty Ltd by Denel here  .  We can't take Mr. Neophytou's word that he is the designer of it, if reliable sources say otherwise.
I'm still reviewing the other wiki_link article, but my initial google search seems to faovr the ""NTW-20 Antimaterial Rifle"" spelling over the ""NTW-20 Anti Materiel Rifle"" spelling you've proposed. T. Neo, I'm not trying to talk down to you, but based on the references that are available, the prior version appears more accurate.  I'm not seeing ""Janes Infantry Weapons 2007-2008"" online and there are only 6 google hits for it.  Also, I google searched ""Neopup PAW-20"" and found no hits as that being the name of anything that has ever existed.  On the other hand there are 48 entries for ""Denel PAW-20 Neopup"" and 108 entries for "" Denel PAW-20"".  The following sites confirm either that Gemaco Elbree Pty Ltd is the developer,or that DENEL is the marketer/namer, which is in line with the earlier citation
*[EXTERNA_LINK: http://www.bellum.nu/armoury/DPAW20Neopup.html]
*[EXTERNA_LINK: http://www.enemyforces.com/firearms/denel_paw20_neopup.htm]
*Now I can't find an online South African patent databse, but in the US patent database there are 38 entries for DENEL and 24 for Neophytou.  If you can identify which patent is for the weapon in question, then that would tend to indicate who should be sourced as the invetor.
*I've read over the article you mention, the ad pictures say ""Manufactured by Gemaco Elbree Precision Engineering"". Even though the top says ""Amended with additional information from the designer, Tony Neophytou, 30 August 2007""  It never mentions him in the article or even says what he is a designer of.  On the other hand, it does mention that Denel munitions makes the cartridges for this weapon. So what I'm saying is that your edits which include ""manufacturer=Neopup PTY LTD"" and ""The Neopup PAW-20 or ""Neopup"" is a wiki_link designed by wiki_link and is marketed by Neopup PTY LTD "" are not supported.  However, you inclusion of Denel as the manufacturing concern of the cartridges is, and I've changed the article as such.

As for what is ""settled"" or not, sometimes ""settled"" takes 2 or 3 days, even a week, because people have a wiki_link and may not get onto Wikipedia everyday.  Also, people giving up because they are just too darn tired to keep fighting isn't ""settled,"" it means that we are worn out, grumpy, feel beat up and so on.  I personally think this article should ultimately have some balance between the plusses and minuses of various designs, and there has to be criticism with the positives.

I realise, accept and understand that 'credit crunch' is a much-used term over recent months, much as is its counterpart (?) 'wiki_link'. However, I observe that both articles were created circa mid- to late- 2007 ie. in recent months. Taking this article, it has the approach of a theoretical treatise on what a 'credit crunch' is and why one may occur. It does not back this up to an acceptable degree with academic or other economically-authoritative sources. The best it's got is an FT article. This is because there are no text books, no journal papers, no lecture notes or anything of that sort available to help write an encyclopedic article at present. It is an original synthesis of observed effects in the media, a couple of which have citation to newspaper stories. Things like diagnosing that they often follow a period of loose credit is to reverse engineer the current situation to produce a novel, if predictable, notion. There are other examples, too. This kind of original synthesis is exactly what wiki_link forbids, unfortunately. I see two routes out of the conundrum of wanting an article on ''the'' credit crunch whilst trying to write about ' ''all'' ' credit-crunches (of which I speculate there have been no other events so named): Somebody proves me comprehensively wrong and finds authoritative, academic, or otherwise peer-reviewed sources we can cite in this tertiary source. (My preferred route). This is rewritten to discuss the proceedings of the present financial turmoil, and is mercilessly stripped of the imputations, interpolations and extrapolations it currently possesses. This will probably result in merging/redirection with/to wiki_link, but might not since its scope is gradually widening to be more than just a subprime-related issue.

You've done that twice now. All I want you to do is (a) NOT DELETE THE ENTIRE SECTION, fictional multiverses do need some mention, and there is nothing wrong with the way there were mentioned before you deleted it, hence, I undid what you did and (b) talk this through, perhaps come up with some compromise about what to do.

The biggest need in an effective deletion system is admins who are capable of being sensitive to the interests of all parties in a deletion discussion.  All those with an interest in a particular discussion, including rank newbies, need to feel that their arguments are being heard.  This does not mean that everything they propose will be kept, but they can at least walk away from a losing argument with the feeling that they may still succeed in future arguments.  This requires patience and humility on the part of those admins, and the ability  to recognize that the peace which comes from giving others the benefit of the doubt may be worth far more than the perfection that comes from eliminating an article of dubious notability.

205710474.27751.27731,1208230035.0," In the first chapter of Communion and Otherness, Zizioulas surveys 20th century Western thinking on personhood in Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre, and then discusses how two Jewish thinkers – Buber and Levinas – make significant philosophical advances over them. However, he then goes on to show how both Buber and Levinas fall short of patristic thinking on personhood. He clearly sees Levinas as coming closest to the patristic understanding, but he points out how, e.g., Dionysius the Areopagite and St Maximus Confessor are superior to Levinas. The same is true of Macmurray, whom Zizioulas credits as having made an insightful critique of other Western views on personhood; he does not, however, base his own thinking of that of Macmurray. Interacting with non-Orthodox philosophers, and acknowledging what is worthwhile and what is deficient in their thinking when compared to the Church Fathers, is not a reason to criticize Zizioulas.

The people behind SFIV have been interested in getting in as many characters as they can and besides, Akuma is a fan fav that has been strongly rumored/wanted and Capcom is interested in putting in more female characters which no doubt, is probably going to include Cammy.  Rest assured the SSF2T cast is probably all going to be in here.  But we'll have to wait for official sources just to be sure.  Still, anyone know about the PC versions cast?

Reverts subvert the wishes of the editing community as a whole. It's better to allow the editing community to decide whether content stays or goes. Content disputes need to go through the dispute resolution process. In regard to the particular sentence about public figures who considered Howard's Iraq policy as contravening international laws against war crimes, I've got no idea if the issue gets put to the community to decide whether it would live or die. It could go either way. But then we just have to accept the community decision. The concept is that by letting the community decide, the audience of Wikipedia readers gets the type of encyclopaedia that they want (or deserve).

251263251.32069.32055,1226462209.0,"On behalf of federal web managers, I would like to get some clarification and guidance and maybe start a discussion regarding employees of the federal government editing Wikipedia articles. I primarily mean civil servants rather than political appointees and specifically as part of our responsibility to provide accurate information to the public. We recognize that Wikipedia is a frequent resource for many Internet users, including us. Our log files show that federal websites receive many referrals from Wikipedia. And many of us support and respect the work that the Wikipedia community does to create quality articles. We understand and have studied policies and guidelines, and more than one of us have edited a page or two. I am reaching out to the Wikipedia community to help us develop appropriate guidelines and policies for external_link and our participation. COI guidelines seem to discourage employees from editing on behalf of employers, but we frequently see information that is unclear or sometimes wrong. While we know we can just edit, we want to do so transparently and acceptably. There is concern that we will offend the Wikipedia community and encourage negative attention if we get this wrong. On the other hand, there are great resources in the federal (and state and local) space that would be valuable to Wikipedia users, and we know about them, and can cite them, too. So, what are the best ways for federal employees to contribute to this project? For example, some federal editors will only edit in their official capacity from a government computer with a government IP and from a Wikipedia account. Should that account indicate the name of the agency? Whether it is a communications or a program office? I don't think there would be any controversy on editing dates that are incorrect or improving a reference or correcting an error (like which agency has jurisdiction over an area). Are there things that we ''shouldn't'' edit? For substantive changes, should we be explicit about our roles on talk pages? If we don't get any feedback on proposed changes, how long should we wait until we make the change ourselves? Other ideas/areas/pitfalls? The goal is to create guidelines and best practices for the federal web community. We will publish on external_link. I am happy to move this to another area if that makes more sense, and if you want to post comments and discussion on my page, please do. Thanks for your help.

I would suggest that you get in the habit of properly attributing quotes and sources, since that really sits at the core of what Wikipedia is; evidently you've been having difficulty keeping who said what straight in your mind, since you've both misattributed statements to the wrong people (like this one) and disregarded sources of facts you clearly find inconvenient.  When you come out in public and write giggle-inducing accolades like ""Like 90% of Americans, I see Warren as a kind, loving man who has done incredible good for the world and is one of the greatest Americans alive,"" you obviously have your own particular set of blinders on for the rest of Warren's activities and peculiar habits of language, about which you seem blissfully unaware. And it's not that I object that you feel that way about him (that discussion, were it to occur, is not relevant to Wikipedia), it's just that you don't seem to have any awareness of how your views affect your editing. Given that, no, if you persist in edit-warring to remove multiply-sourced material that happens to be detrimental to Warren from the article, and habitually calling others' edits vandalism, among other behaviors that show an unwillingness on your part to wiki_link, I will not withdraw my report.

267643437.10104.10093,1233418772.0," First I wish to thank you for your scholarly contributions to the Oneness Pentecostalism article and other articles in Wikipedia..
I too have some contributions to add to the OP article which I feel are valid due to having grown up in the OP environment, having been the offspring of an OP minister, and having had the opportunity to have met many of the leading figures of the movement.
Again I appreciate your contributions to the article, however there is a minor area in which we perhaps disagree.
The ""Dr."" in Dr. Curtis Ward and Dr. Marvin Arnold is more than just an academic or professional title—it has become their name, one by which they are widely known. It has become as honorific as the ""Pope"" in Pope John Paul or the ""Sir"" in Sir Paul McCartney or the ""Dr."" in Dr. Phil.  If you notice this has been changed by others in the past who are familiar with these personalities (with Dr. Ward and Dr. Arnold). It is my concern that others will not readily recognize them outside of their publicly established names. (Also in their circle it has become offensive to not properly reference them with certain prefixes such as ""Elder"", ""Bishop,"" ""Doctor,"" etc.).
Also the guideline Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies), says in the opening statement
"" The objective of this Manual of Style(or style guide) is to provide guidelines for maintaining visual and textual consistency in biographical articles. Adherence to the following guidelines is not required; however, usage of these guidelines is recommended.""
Firstly the Oneness Pentecostalism article is not  a biographical article. Dr. Ward and Dr. Arnold are not mentioned in a biographical sense.
Secondly the style guide says that ""adherence to the following guidelines is not required.""
It is my request that since the abovementioned personalities are well known by their full title and name within their movement, since it it considered offensive not to use certain prefixes within the movement, since this is not a biographical article, and since the style guideline says that adherence to these specific guidelines are not required—it is my request that we in this instance allow the article to use the prefix ""Dr."" in the very brief mention of Dr. Curtis Ward and Dr. Marvin Arnold.

As several previous discussions on this page note, the need to inform the world that the article is an orphan is dubious in the extreme: insisting that the label stay in perpetuity is just plain wrong.

Pre-Spanish Period
The first people in the Philippines, the Negritos, are believed to have come to the islands 30,000 years ago from Borneo and Sumatra, making their way across then-existing land bridges. Subsequently, Malays came from the south in successive waves, the earliest by land bridges and later in boats by sea. The Malays settled in scattered communities, named barangays after the large outrigger boats in which they arrived, and ruled by chieftains known as datus. Chinese merchants and traders arrived and settled in the ninth century, sometimes traveling on the ships of Arab traders, introducing Islam in the south and extending some influence even into Luzon. The Malays, however, remained the dominant group until the Spanish arrived in the 16th century.

INTRODUCTION
The visitor to Metro Manila commonly sees the Philippines as the most westernized of Asian countries and in many ways, it is. But there is also a rich underlay of Malay culture beneath the patina of Spanish and American heritage. National cultural life is a happy marriage of many influences, as the indigenous Malay culture is assimilated and adapted to different strains in a practice typical of Malay temperament. An upsurge of Philippine nationalism stimulated a desire to preserve the ancient heritage without restricting its openness to foreign artistic influence.
The Philippines is an archipelago of 7,107 islands. It stretches from the south of China to the northern tip of Borneo. The country has over a hundred ethnic groups and a mixture of foreign influences which have molded a unique Filipino culture.
Before the Spanish explorers came, Indo-Malays and Chinese merchants had settled here. In 1521, the Spaniards, led by Ferdinand Magellan, discovered the islands. The Spanish conquistadores established a colonial government in Cebu in 1565. They transferred the seat of government to Manila in 1571 and proceeded to colonize the country. The Filipinos resisted and waged Asia's first nationalist revolution in 1896. On June 12, 1898, Emilio Aguinaldo declared the Philippines independent from Spain and proclaimed himself president. After ruling for 333 years, the Spaniards finally left in 1898 and were replaced by the Americans who stayed for 48 years. On July 4, 1946, the Americans recognized Philippine independence.
If people can admit that the Filipino culture also has Chinese and Spanish influences, whats the problem with admitting that Filipinos also have Malay influence? When both the Philippines and USA also provide that exact information.",PinoyFilAmPride,288655305.38122.38122,0.0222773457119289,Normal,288655305.38122.38122,199347779.28791.28791,False,True,True,2018,train,2009-05-08 11:49:46,11,4,Morning,True,False,1.0

Yet none can provide any information to support their claims. Whether they believe it or not, or believe the OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT of the Philippines is corrupt is just their opinion.

Not sure?
In Filipino folklore, they mention that Filipinos came from Malaysia, and Indonesia. However these are legends or stories told in Philippine literatures. Not true!
Fact:
The fact is, Islam was brought from Malayasia, and Indonesia by Muslim traders. (Note: These were not Arab or Hindu traders. They were Malayasians, and Indonesian traders who converted to Islam). Muslim merchants traded with Indigenous Filipino tribes, and converted these Filipino tribes to Islam. Some of the Filipino tribes who converted to Islam were part of the Islamic kingdoms of Borneo.

Yet none can provide any information to support their claims. Whether they believe it or not, or believe the OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT of the Philippines is corrupt is just their opinion. Just like if some random person thought the Official Government Website of the United States of America was corrupt...that still does not give them any right to change that information. I suggest they dispute that information directly with the people who provide that information on that website.
::Why are you offended?. We are simply researching information, and discussing the difference between the term Malay, and Austronesian. We are not talking about politics. wiki_link
::: The real question is, why are you offended? Again, both the Spanish and Chinese are mentioned yet you do not dispute those facts. However when it comes to the term Malay and Austronesian you get all butt-hurt. The term Austronesian is a very broad and general term, it's like saying Mongoloid or or Sino-Tibetan. Both the Philippines and U.S. websites state clearly about the People of the Philippines yet you continue to argue that is wrong....these are both Government websites I might add. This discussion is more of a argument because you simply refuse to acknowledge that the government websites are correct.
For now, I think I'll just leave the Background part from the Article and just leave it as it originally was since too many Filipinos are unsure of their background. You don't even know how to reply and sign correctly, what's up with that? Your ""tends"" to be associated with Malaysia is your opinion. It's like people who say ""ASIA"" tends to be associated with East Asia or just China, therefore Filipinos should not be considered as Asian and should be considered as Pacific Islander. Proper terms is something you are stating as an opinion. The term Austronesian is a very broad and general term, it's like stating Mongoloid or Sino-Tibetan. Then made a ""FALSE"" claim which you backed up with no source or citation for that matter. Both the Philippines Government and U.S. State Websites state clearly about the Indonesian and Malaysian groups, whether you like it or not is just your opinion. Just like when people want to call Filipinos as ""Pacific Islanders"" and not ""Asian"".
Funny how you also blatantly changed the Ethnic Group percentages, yet you used no source to back up those percentages. You also kept the same source that states ""Malay"" and not ""Filipino"". Anyways I really don't care what you have to say anymore because you seem to be all butt-hurt about this whole ""Austronesian"" term which was originally just a term to group languages and not a ethnic group. Even the dictionary only explains it as a group of languages:
noun
1. 	Also called Malayo-Polynesian. a family of languages spoken in the Malay Peninsula, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Madagascar, and Oceania.
–adjective
2. 	of or pertaining to Austronesia or the Austronesian family of languages; Malayo-Polynesian.
I've backed up my sources using 2 reliable sources, which are both from the Philippines and USA. If you have a problem with those websites, I suggest you write and dispute it with them.

Dear Kotiwalo thank you for your calm answer,
However,
The official name of the country as per United Nations is ""Former Yugoslavic Republic of Macedonia"".
How can Wikipedia override United Nations' Decisions and Conventions? On which grounds?
This country was recognized as ""Republic of Macedonia"" by GW Bush administration, possibly the worst US President the world has ever known. In my opinion the latter says it all.
Inhabitants of this country don't know what the term ""Macedonia"" means, whereas in Greek,the term Macedons mean either those
who are tall, either those who come from up (the north), this deriving from the root ""mak"" (makrys/macrys meaning long/tall.
Modern inhabitants of FYROM claim being ascendants of Ancient Macedons but they cannot read their scipts whereas we Greeks can.
This falsification of history is something happening for the first time in Mankind.
Please don't be a part of it.
Best Regards,
Denpap mention Dear Kotiwalo, You say that you are sorry but United Nations is not Wikipedia's Authority. Then who is? GW Bush maybe?
In the UN there are talks being carried out for the last 15 years in regard to this country's naming without success and Wikipedia solved the matter just in 1 month's talk?

Because you have contributed the beginnings of useful content to the encyclopedia, I am cutting you considerable slack, but the next time you revert to an unencyclopedic version of the article with no explanation given, I will take action to ensure that it cannot happen again. Let's not step over that line, okay? You'll get along fine here if you observe some basic house rules, and that includes communicating substantively and respectfully with your fellow editors. We have gone out of our way to be helpful to you, and you are seriously disrespecting us in return. It may sound weird, but via is the only appropriate preposition I can think of for the context. With works in casual conversation but is too imprecise for an encyclopedia article. Your preferred wording essentially says ""the bottom can be reached with a hike"", which doesn't make sense; it's like saying ""Los Angeles can be reached with a freeway"". The revised wording with via says ""the bottom can be reached by means of a hike,"" which makes perfect sense.

In my opinion no-one participating in this debate can claim the moral high-ground. I'm not going to name names, or dig too deeply into what has gone before. but for ease of reference, the following acts will NOT be tolerated on Wikipedia.
1 - No personal attacks of any form. This ranges from outright insults to accusations of right-wing/left-wing bias, and accusations that people are not editing in good faith for whatever reason. Also includes accusations that people are ""newbies"", people are ignorant of policy, and anything else about an editor and which is not related to improving this article. I personally believe everyone here is attempting to edit in good faith. Regrettably you just have completely opposite viewpoints. It happens.
2 - Actions must be considered individually Just because UserX has made 20 edits you felt were wrong, this does not entitle you to automatically revert Edit 21.
3 - Don't label stuff you don't agree with as vandalism - Saying ""Mark Levin has goatsex"" is vandalism, as is writing ""Wikipedia Sucks"". However content disputes are NOT vandalism. They are content disputes. If anyone uses the ""vandalism"" tag in future, they'd better be on solid ground.
4 - wiki_link. If a comment is not directly related to the issue of improving the article about Mark Levin, then it can be removed as per the terms of our ""Not a Forum"" policy. This cuts either way. Discussions about the motivations of editors fall on the right side of this debate... but only barely.
5 - All editors benefit from wiki_link. There was a call to vandalise this article made by the subject himself. As deplorable as this is, we are not entitled to take specific action against the subject's article as ""retribution"" (beyond the semi-protection already undertaken.) It may be the case that previously dormant accounts arise to give this article a ""pro"" viewpoint. Or maybe these past users decided to start editing again. By their edits shall we know them.
6 - Thou shalt not wiki_link.

As a hobby botanist I have a lot of Crocus species in my garden, including several autumn-flowering ones. I have also put several pictures of them on Commons, including one of the rare Crocus matthewii.
The classification proposed by B. Matthew, the guru of crocusses,I have implemented on 14 October 2009, 20:16, although not ideal, is the one which is generally accepted, and books and other websites are referring to it.
I find the changes made by  premature since they are based on recent (March 2009) phylogenic work, which have to be confirmed by ""further studies"" to consider a new hierachical system of classification. Futhermore the changes made by  are not user-friendly (strikethrough words, paragraph in parentheses) and are even source of confusion, because not in full accordance with the text he has added.
As I did in wiki_link I have retained B. Matthew's classification as such. I have added a paragraph with the results of the recent (March 2009) phylogenic work, waiting for the results of ""further studies"" before changing accepted B. Matthew's classification.

If it continues in the vein I have seen, I will likley seek to have you barred from further participation on the article. Here are some notes on things you could do to improve your editing.
1. You need to seek consensus for changes that may be controvercial, as opposed to merely making those changes and hoping that they are either missed or that they are protected by the 1rr probation the article is under. There are a number of ways you could do this - you could propose your changes on the talk page and then wait for many comments, specifically looking for comments from people that have problems with your edits, correcting the problems they have, and then resoliciting their opinion. Another option is to make the changes you would like to the article, but expressly state that any editor may revert them, or that you would revert them on demand.
2. Blogs are never acceptable sources. If the only source you can find for something is a blog, it should never be included in an article. If you are sure something is true - it's not. You need a source for all information you intend to put in the article.
3. You should ""write for the enemy"" - when you are making an edit, be sure you know what the response from people who are traditionally on the other side of the debate from you would think of it, and make specific consessions to what problems you would expect them to have with it.
4. Edit summaries should be accurate. If you are reverting, note that. If you are making multiple changes, don't just mention one change and hope the rest go under the radar.

Cheers, I'm disappointed that no one seems interested, but nonetheless I will trek to the library (i.e. Fenwick Library of George Mason University) today after work and take notes from The Persians: An Introduction (2006, Routledge) by Maria Brosius. Its scope covers Persian history from the Achaemenids, to the Arsacids, and the entire Sassanid period. I was hoping to find a decent book on Parthia alone, but this will have to do. I hope someone else would like to contribute as well! I'm also going to look at The Cambridge History of Iran (1983), specifically Volume 3, parts 1 and 2, which the library fortunately has .",PericlesofAthens,347122190.4034.4034,0.0625716446481941,Normal,347122190.4034.4034,314955178.1235.1028,False,True,True,2018,train,2010-03-10 20:14:13,20,2,Evening,True,False,1.0

I'll also add to you (Malleus) that you really do need to take on board what NYB is saying there. Regardless of who's in the wrong this time, there ''is'' a reason the Civility Police watch you. Remember that rant of mine a few months ago about why the civility policy doesn't work because of cultural differences? It cuts both ways; yes, west-coast Americans are generally hypersensitive about things which wouldn't even register on the radar in Bolton, Boston or Brisbane, but ''you know that''. There's no point antagonising people for no reason, if there's an easy way to reword whatever you were about to say that won't offend them. (To take a comment from that Joseph Merrick discussion above, ""retarded"" is an absolutely standard term in the US, but we don't use it on Wikipedia because it has offensive connotations in Britain.) Giano said long ago that the best way to approach Wikipedia is to assume everyone is 14 years old, and it's good advice; try not to say anything you wouldn't say to a 14 year old whom you don't know very well. – ",Iridescent,373117697.22244.22244,0.23754409,Normal,373117697.22244.22244,373143411.24663.24663,True,True,True,2018,train,2010-07-12 18:22:19,18,0,Evening,True,False,1.0

The behavior of some Evolutionary Psychologists like Pinker annoys me because he misrepresents his opponents viewpoint just as much as some EP-critics misrepresent EP, and because he takes on the role of the poor victim of political correctness which is a ridiculous coming from a guy that makes a great living being ""politically incorrect"" whatever that is. As for EP itself I'm rather indifferent - I don't find universals of human behavior or psychology very interesting because they are, well...universal. I am more interested in differences, how to explain them, how to understand what they mean for the lives of individual human beings and how knowledge about individual differences can be used to improve life for individual human beings. For example I don't see what good comes from knowing that males are naturally prone to agression (its not new or surprising for one) - it just detracts attention from the interesting question - why aren't all males aggressive? Why don't all stepmothers abuse their children? Why don't all socially disadvataged men rape women? Why aren't all men promiscuous? Those are the interesting questions and the answers to those questions can help us iomprove society and life for us humans - and EP can't provide them. I believe very strongly as someone once told Humphrey Bogart that ""Nature is what we are put in this world to rise above"" - I don't see how EP is going to help us in that task. But by all means let them study ""human nature"" if they find it fascinating - I also don't believe that anyone needs EP to provide a scientific basis for discrimination and social darwinism, people have been able to discriminate and oppress for millenia without the help of psychologists, I don't think EP is dangerous.

But then the NRHP listing name, from 1969, was in fact accurately using name Jonesboro Historic District.  This apparently is not, was not, listed on the National Register as ""Jonesborough Historic District"".  I don't see any evidence that there is a historic district of the Jonesborough name, i.e. i don't think there was a name change put through in the National Register system or that the district is officially or unofficially known as ""Jonesborough Historic District"".

::::I imagine that the good people are unaware that anyone thinks that the old spelling of their town's name is permanently affixed to their historic district. History is a major source of local pride and economic activity in Jonesborough, where guided tours of the ""Jonesborough Historic District"" are one of the main tourist attractions. I doubt that anyone has told the local people who nominated their town's downtown area for the National Register back in the 1960s, say with pride that theirs ""was the first town in Tennessee to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places,"" and have been maintaining and promoting the area for all these years that bureaucrats in Washington, DC, now own their historic district and now insist that it must forever use the town's old name. I doubt that anyone has told them that because it isn't true.

I do see one more mention of ""Jonesborough's Historic District"" in one of those, but in fact not a single proper noun naming for the district.  In fact, calling it ""Jonesboro Historic District"" as it was and apparently still is named, provides a nice historical touch reflecting the fact that the town was for much of its history named Jonesboro.

I do know something that would be very useful in even making reverting vandalism easier. It is a neat component of the MediaWiki Software (that I have and use) that allows you to revert all the edits a user has made in a row on a designated page in just one click. It is called wiki_link. Rollback should only be used to revert obvious vandalism and other disruptive edits. I highly recommend that you request rollback (you can do so by clicking external_link, but I recommend you read wiki_link first. Hi, this is Awawawawoo.  You've sent me two messages about editing the Deism article, stating that I vandalized it by removing a statement at the end of the second paragraph about the founding fathers.  I removed it after reading the article's discussion, and decided that it was an opinion, not fact, and currently being debated by historians.  I also didn't understand why an opinionated statement about the founding fathers was being included in the opening paragraphs of an article defining Deism, so removed the questionable quote.  If you read in the discussion, you'll find that the source for the quote is also questionable, and that the quote is vague.  I didn't see this as being particularly contentious, and decided that if there was a debate the best solution was to removed the controversial material.  However, you seem to think I've done something wrong, so I was wondering if I have?  I haven't edited on here in years, and didn't bother finding my original login, just created another one on the fly.  I guess I'll check back here, to see if you can take a closer look at my edits.

435569895.1448.1448,1308709099.0,"What I said is true.  The comment above that one said this: ""A few points of clarification. I think that, here at wikipedia, our personal assessment of a particular source often needs to be held in check. Your assessment of Frazer's interpretation of Jefferson's statement is different from mine. It seems to me that Jefferson's words clearly indicate a general belief in God's involvement in human affairs. Frazer's work has an entire chapter, not a ""vague sentence"" on Jefferson's religious views. For the article, lengthy discussion is not appropriate, so I presented Frazer's strongest single piece of evidence, which is usually ignored by the ""Jefferson-was-a-Deist"" camp. Secondly, I was not disputing Enlightenment influence on the American founders, but rather the threefold connection of Deism, Enlightenment, and the American founding. I have read May's book, as well as many other books relating to Enlightenment philosophy, American colonial education, and the lives and thinking of the founders, including lesser-known founders like Witherspoon, Wythe, and Wilson. The Americans were much more likely to read theists like Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, for example, than Voltaire or Rousseau. There were cross-currents in the Enlightenment, so the vague, unsourced statement linking Deism, the Enlightenment, and the American founders seems to be not only against wikipedia policy, but also misleading and unhelpful. Other Choices"" This user seems much better informed over all.  And there are several comments above that one, and the one you quoted I found to be the least informative and the most opinionated.  Phrases like ""Republican rant book"" and claiming, without referencing anything in specific, that said book(s) isn't properly research, or however they put it, is perfectly meaningless.  All they gave was a political opinion, when you boil down the substance.  And this statement: ""several of the founding fathers were Deists"" is also opinion, based on the fact that there are history books that contradict each other on the subject.  If you like, I can reference a few books for you to read. )  — Preceding wiki_link comment added by   • ",Awawawawoo,433130034.562.562,0.10175203,Normal,433130034.562.562,433247719.840.840,False,True,True,2018,val,2011-06-22 02:18:19,2,2,Night,True,False,1.0

That's partly why I posted here, to find out about the rules. I guess I'll continue discussing this with PTJoshua, then. I think he's checking up here, so I'll just put up a book I googled pretty fast, titled ""Founding Faith: Providence, Politics, and the Birth of Religious Freedom in America"" by by Steven Waldman. I particularly liked a quote from one of the editorial reviews of the book: “Steven Waldman does a great job describing the nuances of the Founders’ beliefs and the balances they struck, thus rescuing them from those on both sides who would oversimplify their ideas.” –Walter Isaacson, president of the Aspen Institute and author of Benjamin Franklin: An American Life. Anywho, when I googled ""Founding fathers deism amazon"" (or it may have been ""founding fathers deist amazon"") many different books came up which argued both sides of the ""most of the founders are deists"" argument. All I've said is that the statement that it is widely accepted that most of the founders are deists is highly debated, and thus not appropriate in the introductory paragraphs of a wikipedia article on Deism.

I'm commenting here, not elsewhere, because really this is just a comment to you, Ohms law;
My own concern over wiki_link not being a redirect is based on what I believe to be a firm policy, BLP1E, and - despite everything I've read - I can't understand why it isn't. Thus, of course, I think ErrantX was right to redirect it; whether xe was right to protect it is another matter, and I'm not so sure.
But...unless I'm totally misunderstanding policy, we have a situation with an article on a living person in direct contradiction to a BLP policy.
I queried wiki_link closure with the closing admin; it seems to me a very inappropriate SNOW closure, but xe refuses to accept that BLP1E is a policy. Please, see .
Thus, I have two unresolved concerns - the article itself, and the fact that utcursch seems to have a very different understanding of BLP policy to mysef. And I don't really know how to deal with those concerns, or where.
One option would be DRV - but, after the days that would take - followed, presumably, by another AfD. That'd cause DRAMA and it's quite possible that by the time it concluded, the article subject will have moved beyond BLP1E (due to increased coverage, more RS relating to his life unconnected to the event itself) - so, probably a waste of effort.

The text that was removed wasn't about this article, it was about catalytic converters per se, and that is not appropriate material for this talk page. Look at the top of the talk page and you'll see a notice that this is not a forum for discussing catalytic converters, but rather is for working on the article itself, and that material not apposite to that narrow goal can and may be removed. There's nothing to be annoyed about here; the quarrel started out barely on topic (you raised the idea of a book about catalytic converters and asked for people to bring you some ideas on your own talk page, which was okeh), and quickly strayed far from any semblance of relevance to this article. If you want to have a debate of that nature somewhere on Wikipedia, it would need to be on a personal talk page/s.

You seem to believe that using a question mark for a probable year is a better way to handle the case where the year is a probable exact year, while the use of ""c."" implies more inaccuracy, so, with ""c. 1162"", 1160, 1161, 1163 and 1164 can be considered just about as likely as 1162. I understand where you are going with this, I think, but I doubt that the average reader or the average editor is going to understand. How does a question mark in one case imply uncertainty on the part of Wikipedia editors, and in the other case not imply that?  I also don't think a gnome who is cleaning up pages and sees (born 1950?) is going to know which way to go; is it left over from an editor who wanted to express a vague year from the late 1940s or early 1950s and who had not read ""Do not use a question mark for this function"", or was it a carefully analyzed case of a probable year, with a smaller chance that it is actually 1952?

491081233.1235.1235,1336344704.0," Hey! Please check out wiki_link. In particular, under Parameters, the section on the note parameter: ""An optional note to be displayed in parentheses behind the title. Useful for original titles in other languages/scripts (e.g., kanji) or to denote bonus tracks only included in certain editions. Keep notes short. Excessive commentary disrupts the flow of the track listing, which should be easily scannable."" (emphasis mine). Splitting the track listing is unnecessary, especially if the article has never had the bonus tracks split in the first place (that's generally how things are done on Wikipedia: if there is more than one way of doing things, stick with how it was done first, like using one date format vs. another (wiki_link)).
Additionally, avoid using the collapse parameter unless it's necessary: ""Include this parameter with the value yes (|collapsed=yes) to have the track listing table start out collapsed. Useful for very long lists or pages with several lists. This parameter only takes effect in JavaScript-enabled browsers."" (emphasis mine). Two lists is hardly ""several lists"".
Here's an example of when it's good to split off track lists and collapse them: wiki_link. One long list and several different sets of bonus tracks. But an album with only two editions can just have the bonus tracks kept in the same listing and use the note parameter to denote bonus tracks.

500740735.20916.20916,1341456691.0," What level of ""Proof"" are various editors looking for? In my case, I knew my long deceased grandfather was on the Dawes Rolls taken of the Cherokee in the early 1900s. However, it took almost 40 years (no exaggeration) to find enough ""proof"" to meet BIA standards to get a Certified Degree of Indian Blood (CDIB) card. After that, getting Cherokee Nation citizenship was easy.
Years ago, I recall the State of California telling me I could not claim to be of Cherokee ancestry on official forms because I was not a citizen at the time. That was extremely frustrating. Five years later when I was a citizen, the state no longer had that section on their forms.
I can see omitting people who have made a claim of ancestry, but documentation shows they are not. I have come across many people who ""feel"" they are American Indian, but have no specific details.
Perhaps the editors who wish to delete some questionable people could contact those people directly to see if they want to be on the list; and if so, could they provide some proof of their claim or the basis of their claim. Then the editors could at least have something to go on.
FYI, while the Cherokee Nation has approximately 300,000 enrolled citizens, over 750,000 people self-claimed Cherokee ancestry during the most recent census. Many people are familiar with the part of Cherokee history called the Trail of Tears which moved the Cherokees to Indian Territory (Oklahoma) in the 1830s. However, many Cherokees left our ancestral lands decades before the removal. Many settled in what now is Arkansas and Missouri. After the ""Trail,"" The US government took numerous rolls of tribal members. If you did not live in the ""official"" Cherokee lands in Indian Territory, you were not included in those rolls. All of those Cherokees in Arkansas and Missouri (just to name a few, others went to Mexico/Texas, etc.) were not included in most rolls. Presently, the Cherokee Nation's primary requirement to become a citizen is being able to trace your blood ancestry back to anyone listed as Cherokee on the Dawes rolls. It does not matter what your blood-quantum is, just verifiable Cherokee blood. So, if your full-blooded Cherokee grandfather and your full-blooded Cherokee grandmother were not on the rolls, you will not be able to become a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, even if you are full-blooded Cherokee.
This all just goes to show that ""proof"" can be hard to come by, and varies from person to person.

If you can specifically cite what in the entry offends instead of restoring a boilerplate header that makes generalizations about inadequacies, perhaps I will not have to make wildass guesses about what would please self-appointed Wiki editors who seem unable to apply their principles universally, nor seem able to express problems with jargon and sentence fragments that carry no meaning, nor can explain away countless other entries that do the same as mine.

Restoring a vague boilerplate header that has been addressed is not especially helpful. I look at other entries for models, and you respond that those are not good, either. What good is that response? Standards unequally applied are  arbitrary self-appointed editors making up punitive rules as they go along.
To be sure I understand your notion of a source: If a writer is awarded the Pulitzer Prize, would you prefer a citation to a secondary sourcesuch as her hometown newspaperor the primary source, which would be the Pulitzer Committee at Columbia University? If I am named a Fellow in Massachusetts, would you prefer a secondary source like my local newspaper, or is the link and note to the State superior?
For specifics:
There are no references to self-published sources. Not one.
If the close connection to the subject is that I am maintaining the entry, if you wish I'll find someone else to do that work.
Since you dislike primary sources, exactly how does one offer citations for verification? I link to the state of Massachusetts profile of me: is that verification of their award or will you complain that is a primary source?
If five books and major grants and more than 50 published fictions in noteworthy literary journals do not establish notability, what does? I could list themlink free-like Lee K.

513870440.3898.3898,1348234524.0," Hello, I have observed that since this century turned, new cars have had headlamp lenses made out of plastic. Before headlamp lenses were made out of thick glass that reminded me of wiki_link cooking vessels intended for use inside an oven. Is it true that it was in fact heat-resistant borosilicate glass? What is the plastic in use nowadays? I suppose it is wiki_link plastic, but is it regular or somehow treated/coated? I would want answers to these questions in the article. Also, were the transition to plastic lenses possible only after halogen lamps became history? I believe that halogen lamps emitted so much heat that polycarbonate would have melted. So, if the transition was only possible because of technological development in lamps, and a consequence of this (better efficiency, less heat), please point it out in the article. Also, I suppose the use of plastic resulted in weight savings, but is there some drawbacks in plastic? I found some info about high heat polycarbonate.

513884366.3985.3985,1348241116.0," This  says that US makers started using plastic headlamps in the 1980's to save weight. The polycarbonate plastic is less dense than glass, adn the whole reflector/lens assembly can be made with fewer metal parts, further reducing weight. Google Books says Popular Mechanics was writing about plastic lenss in cars in 1991 (comparing their high replacement cost with the cheap sealed beam bulbs). I don't think old-time glass lenses were anything special but maybe I can find a reference as to the kind of glass used; recall that an old-time ""sealed beam"" used to sell for a coupe of bucks, so I doubt the glass was anything otehr than good old soda-lime ( or maybe with some lead oxide?). So, I don't think it was tied to halogen lamps as much as to the push to save weight in the days of ever-decreasing CAFE standards. Original research: my 1973 Meteor, 1981 K-Car and 1986 VW Jetta all had glass headlamp lenses (and every one of them had a hole in a lens and a burnt bulb as a result), my '94 Passat had plastic (I think...don't recall), and my curent 7-year-old car has plastic lenses, which have yet to develop a hole (but which are getting yellow).",Wtshymanski,513868198.3527.3527,0.0176566386204291,Normal,513868198.3527.3527,521109525.5453.5453,False,True,True,2018,train,2012-09-21 15:25:16,15,4,Afternoon,True,False,1.0
513895003.4458.4458,1348245942.0," ""Plastic"" headlamp lenses are indeed made of polycarbonate with a coating applied to the front face to protect the polycarbonate from damage by abrasion and UV exposure. In the US, the polycarbonate material and coating combination must be on the external_link of materials that are manufacturer-certified as having passed the tests specified in external_link; these include a 3-year outdoor exposure period in Arizona (sunny and dry) and the same in Florida (sunny and humid) after which no more than 30% haze is permitted. Outside the US, the wiki_link on headlamps contain requirements for plastic materials. They're broadly similar (polycarbonate material with coating) but they use an accelerated test with an electric source of UV light (an unshielded arc lamp) rather than putting the material samples out in the sun for a few years. Aside from some early experiments at GE with polycarbonate-lens sealed beams, the first plastic headlamp lenses in the US came out for 1984 on Ford's new-that-year composite replaceable-bulb headlamps. The choice of plastic rather than glass was entirely cost-based. European (rest of the world) regulations did not permit plastic lenses until 1993. The plastic materials are more versatile with respect to styling; more complicated shapes can more easily be moulded. And the plastic lenses weigh less, and are more compatible with European pedestrian-protection regulations governing maximum impact force on pedestrian legs, knees, etc.
:::Glass headlamp lenses were and are made of either soda-lime ""soft"" glass or borosilicate ""hard"" glass, depending on the specific headlamp design and manufacturer. Sometimes lenses are further treated (tempered/toughened) for heavy-duty service as required by the intended application.
:::Which one's better, plastic or glass? Neither, overall; each has its merits and drawbacks. Glass is breakable, but plastic cooks in the sun and can't effectively be polished (you wind up polishing the hard coat off the lens, then the degradation comes back faster and worse). Replaceable lenses aren't as common as they once were even outside North America because the complex shapes of today's styled headlamps make it very difficult to obtain a good and durable seal without gluing the lens to the housing. Within North America replaceable lenses have always been permitted but never been common because headlamps so equipped are subject to more stringent requirements for reflector durability and repeatable seal integrity, which means higher cost to manufacture.

In 40+ years of driving (more than 500,000 miles combined over a dozen or so vehicles), I have never had a glass lens get broken or cracked (other than the head-on highway collision we suffered in our 1969 Saab 95 which we all walked away from without a scratch BTW). Both of the glass lens on my 23-year-old Honda Accord LX Station Wagon are as clear as the day they were installed (and this car has been parked outside all of it's life). My wife's 2001 Suzuki XL-7, on the other hand, has these fancy plastic lens which have to be polished every few months in order to maintain any semblance of transparency. Surprise! The fancy plastic lens is NOT available separately and NON-OEM replacements list at $200 or more. The dealer quoted us roughly $1,300, installed, to replace both sides with ""genuine OEM"" parts. Know how much it costs to replace the Honda's headlight if and when it ever breaks? $50 each side (and that includes the sidelight as well). Plastic or glass? Please. The only reason plastic was let in back in 1983 is because everyone was all goo-goo gah-gah over plastic and trying to give everything the ""aero"" look to impress the ladies in charge with fancy pictures and such while trying to justify the millions being poured into CAD design systems. Plastic, in and of itself, is probably the worst material ever considered for a lens that has to maintain optical clarity under 24/7/365 exposure to direct sunlight.

When Alien Resurrection came out at cinemas, the first three movies were released in a VHS boxed set with a Making of Alien Resurrection tape. A few months later, the same set was re-released with Alien Resurrection itself replacing the making-of video. This set was available in both widescreen and pan-and-scan versions.

:I was trying to point out that the Article did not reflect the increasing controversy that this federal education program is gaining in, especially, Bible Belt states.  There are many criticisms of this program aside from educational ones.  There are a number of concerns among Christians that this program not only takes control of local schools' curriculum away from the local school boards and puts it entirely in the US Dept of Education's hands, but that it will also take away parental oversight of children.  For example, there is a concern that a school principal and/or nurse may have the right to send a child to a hospital or doctor w/out the parent's/s' consent.  What if the family happens to be members of the The First Church of Christ, Scientist Small text,and does not believe in treatment by Medical Doctors??? This is just one criticism.

By a show of hands (or comments), does this revision to the article's ""critical reception"" section smack of POV content removal (WP:VNT), editorializing (WP:WORDS), and undue weight to minority viewpoints (WP:UNDUE)? Oh, and being neutral in form, considering most of the reviews that the album received were ""mixed"", as verified by Metacritic and The Independent, both of which are cited in the article, yet the editor seems to overlook that (""using metacritic is lazy""?), along with a few other reliable third-party sources (GoogleNews' index of sources, The Huffington Post) Dan56 (talk)
The Aaliyah album was rated 76. That's a fact.  Reverse me again and I'll bring your words from the other page to the forum. Listen, I appreciate what you're saying.  But it's also abundantly clear that you respect old-school artists- so do I.  But, when I viewed the discourse, you showed a lot of bias on that Nicki Minaj album.  Be reasonable.  You can't ""as verified by metacritic"" on one, and then ""it's not the end-all"" on another artist.  Let up on one or the other.  You need to be consistent.  i think you're probably a great editor- but that kind of thing will sink you.  It's way too obvious you are leaning to the old-schoolers.  Which I can't blame you for.  I agree!!  But seriously, when I read all your comments, your definitely in the old-school camp, and clearly ""shaping it,"" shall we say.  I'll change it to ""highly positive.""  But if you get in those pissing matches trying to prove the new artists like Nikki whatever are not as cool, I'm gonna call attention to your contracdictions.  Wikipedia has to be consistent and you are not the king- ok?  I'll change it back if you feel that strongly. Undid my changes- wanted to show good faith. REchecked all the reviews.

In providing your input on the topic under debate in that discussion, you have made several personal remarks about me. This started when you suggested that there was a direct relation between me and the individuals upon which I was editing about, as shown here . I warned you that your remarks were assuming bad faith and were personal in nature because they related to me as opposed to the content of the article. This is against talk page policies. You would then follow this up by continuing to relate the discussion to me by uncivilly bringing up stuff about my retirement notice here at Wikipedia in a discussion in which this is entirely irrelevant, as shown here . I am now choosing to address your behavior here as your remarks don't belong at that talk page and will merely throw off the focus of that debate.

Is it correct to call this a Coriolis effect or does it have its own name? Does anyone know? The reason I don't think it's Coriolis is that this effect is at a maximum at the equator and disappears at the polesprecisely the reverse of Coriolis. (It is of course minute, which was why it was very hard to observe.)
There's a reference to Riccioli quoting this as an objection to the movement of the earth (objection B6 p70 of the cited text). But as with cannon ball argument (B17 p75) which credits Tycho Brahe, the falling object argument was used by Tycho: ""Tycho Brahe maintained that this argument about the falling stone was unanswerable.""

I just want to inform you that something terrible happened in the Japanese Wikipedia.
They implemented a so-called ""local rule"" for AKB48-related articles that prohibits adding member lists for B-sides into articles about AKB48's singles. It also says to order the remaining list alphabetically and not by teams. IP editors have tried to put the lists back, but they are being reverted. I personally think that the articles are ruined and that the Japanese Wikipedia has became absolutely useless for anyone who wants to browse through AKB48's releases.
The proposal that resulted in the rule had remained practically unnoticed or ignored. I wonder why. There were just 2–3 editors, and they decided everything for everyone. I didn't notice it too.
Actually, it's not like they deleted the info from Wikipedia, they moved it all into the monstrous wiki_link. The list is very long and completely unusable. (I think some people like to make very long lists for everything. This is especially true for the Japanese Wikipedia.)
That's just for your information. I am thinking about proposing to allow the lists back into the articles and to rearrange them as before, exactly as in the CD booklets. But it won't be now. Now I am not going to do anything. It would be nice if someone with a better knowledge of Japanese offers help in composing the proposal. I think they just made a mistake and if it were in English it would be possible for me to convince them reconsider. That's all.

1. Rough Tower is the name that exists on the official UK Ordinance Survey maps;
2. Rough Tower is the name painted on UK Ministry of Defence buoys marking Rough Tower;
3. Rough Tower is actually two towers joined by a platform above the surface and below the surface the two towers form the superstructure of HMS Roughs, a WWII Royal Navy barge sunk on Rough Sands.
4. Rough Tower is not an island but the superstructure of a former Royal Navy boat.
5. Rough Sands is a part of the UK as established by the fact that the USA and UN all agree that Rough Sands is a part of the UK and there are no international disputes to the contrary.
6. A USA federal court case settled the issue about Rough Tower in 1990-1991 and found that ""Sealand"" does not exist.
7. Roy Bates has stated that he was in a pub having a drink with his wife Joan when he dreamed up the idea of making her a princess.
8. The occasion that gave rise to the ""Sealand"" myth was the naming of Prince Charles as the Prince of the Principality of Wales by his mother, the sovereign.
9. No sovereign has ever confered any title of prince on Roy Bates.
10. A principality can only be created by a principal state.
11. The UK being the principal state having jurisdiction has never created a principality on Rough Sands.
12. Military wrecks are not subject to the same laws as ordinary vessels for salvage purposes and HMS Roughs is a military wreck.

6555625.39331.39331,1097636061.0," The story is not ""cool"" it is a hoax and a fraud. Second, what you are stating is that Wikipedia is a load of rubbish and cannot be relied upon as a source of factual material. If I thought that I would not be here and if you convince me of that I will be gone from here! From what I can see the concept of Wikipedia is good because it is open sourced in the sense that POV stuff is difficult to maintain on Wikipedia without someone coming along who knows the facts and exposing the nonsense - whether it be jet engines or identification of turtles. There are exceptions and this topic seems to be one of them because the facts are not stated in the article. The problem with the article is that ""Sealand"" as a story exists but ""Sealand"" as a micronation does not and never has existed. It is a hoax and a fraud and it should be treated as such. If you think otherwise, then please address the points outlined above which are about as clear as I can make them. I have added the words ""claims to be"" before the word micronation because in addition to claiming to be a sovereign state it claims to be a micronation even though no nation and no international body of law on the Planet Earth agrees that it is. Just the opposite is true. The United States of America and the United Kingdom have stated on the public record in a court of law which has been reviewed and upheld, that ""Sealand"" does not exist as either a micronation or as a sovereign state it is just a sunken Royal Navy barge sitting on a sandbar within UK territorial waters. I will not claim that ""Sealand"" does not exist at all because that issue has already been addressed here and clearly something called ""Sealand"" exists. But what is clear is that it is neither a micronation nor is it a sovereign state and for that matter neither is it a principality. Now isn't it time that this silly and childish article is totally written to show that it is both a hoax and a fraud?

Here's the thing: I was linked from another wiki to this one regarding Searchlight, but then I noticed in the popular usage section how the information was wrong regarding the fictional accident in the game Fallout, New Vegas. It had no sources, unfortunately, and that's where I should have added that, and instead just corrected the information. But here's what angered me: one administrator by the name of

For context, here is a link to the complete diff of your recent changes: [EXTERNA_LINK: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islam_and_Sikhism&type;=revision&diff;=665563953&oldid;=665254592]
: Food: Your additions on food and Islam are wrong - halal is required (makroub) not just recommended. Halal food requirements are many and varied, and fall into the larger spectrum of what is halal and haram. To talk about animal slaughter process in detail is not neutrally representative of all differences. I have temporarily restored the version I wrote, on the understanding that this should be expanded to include animal slaughter in some way. Let's please try to avoid emotions when it comes to this topic, and remain as neutral and factual as possible.
: Circumcision: I am not sure why this needs to be a seperate section, or why it should be under 'food' rather than grooming... but you have misrepresented FGM. It has been widely criticized by Muslim authorities around the world, and in nations where it is carried out it is not restricted to Muslim populations. I have removed this passage, please check here for more details: wiki_link
: Prayer: could you please explain the removal of this section - it would seem to be quite relevant to the topic, and is adequately cited?
: Apostasy: I have softened the language on this on the basis of practice - Apostasy is relatively common, and usually does not result in a death penalty unless the apostate challenges the state.
: Views on other religions: In my view, this was inaccurate - I used this abstract of the book you cited to provide a better description: [EXTERNA_LINK: http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199359363.do]
: Food Taxation and Charity: I am not sure why this section was removed, the Gurdawara is surely a clear difference, as is taxation.
: Sufism: Sufism is not considered to be blasphemous in Islam. Please See article wiki_link.

Simply saying the whole thing - that has been developed over years by multiple editors from various political perspectives - should be replaced with a version that a single editor (with a single, highly charged POV) has worked on for about a month is what makes no sense.

In the Intro, it introduces the various views and the two key questions that each view needs to answer.  The body of the article discusses the evidence supporting each view.

691647753.5281.5281,1448090489.0,"Hi Sciencewatcher, I'm the editor who reverted some of your recent changes to the Psychosomatic medicine page. I think you have a point about my wording, which wasn't great. But I'm concerned that the way you have re-expressed things implies the evidence for a role for stress in peptic ulcer is strong. I do not think this is the case. The article you cite by Fink as support for this claim presents the following evidence: - the lack of 100% correspondence between presence of H pylori and peptic ulcer. This doesn't demonstrate a role of mental stress specifically, and it has already been mentioned earlier in the WP page - the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake was followed by a significant increase in the number of people with peptic ulceration (doesn't demonstrate a mental stress link, could be a hygiene issue, or any number of things). - the high rate of stomach ulcers amongst the physically injured and those with severe burns (independent of H pylori). This is very different from the idea of ""mental stress"" that is being claimed by the author. Its a huge stretch! - references to other people's opinions, arguments, conclusions (Creed, Levenstein). Just citing someone who agrees with the author is obviously not evidence. None of these claims provides supporting evidence for the statement that stress plays a role in peptic ulcer. To state such a thing in WP, we need supporting evidence. Otherwise it must remain a ""position"" or a ""view"" as I was trying to empahsise (but perhaps not very  prettily). More generally, we need to find a way of presenting the views of the psychosomatic medicine which is fair to their perspective, but does not simply present their hypotheses as uncontroversial fact (their perspective has come under a lot of criticism of late, and some appears to be well justified in my view).

::Read his Wiki article? Wiki articles do not count. At all. Not a reliable source. Also what I did read says, An updated version of the book, Engines of Creation 2.0, which includes more recent papers and publications, was published as a free ebook on February 8, 2007. That means you are trying to use a free Ebook which is self published apparently. That is not a good idea. Apparently Drexler is an academic with fans but also people that are not fans and do not like his approach.
::The book and the theories it presents have been the subject of some controversy. Scientists such as Nobel Laureate Richard Smalley and renowned chemist George M. Whitesides have been particularly critical. Smalley has engaged in open debate with Drexler, attacking the views presented for what he considered both the dubious nature of the science behind them, and the misleading effect on the public's view of nanotechnology. That from the wiki'' article. So Unless some better version like a third party version of people commenting on Drexler or critiquing Drexler is used then this link is not suitable. Its a self published book. His wifes email address is at the end of the book and his email. Its a personal website. It appears that it is not the actual book in its original form.

709789654.861.843,1457837482.0," Wikipedia's current policies on conflict of interest editing, which often involves promotional content, are really ill suited for the current reality. It may have worked a decade ago, but today's Wikipedia is very different and companies continue to view it as a promotional platform. COI editing is everywhere you look now, and is especially noticeable on pages about companies. The number of COI users editing also outnumbers editors capable and interested in spotting and removing the inappropriate content. The editors interested in removing inappropriate COI content are also ill equipped to detect inappropriate edits on over 5 million articles. I don't mean to be doomsayer, but it honestly seems inappropriate COI editing has become out of hand and judging by the COIN archives, it's only gotten worse.
If current trends continue, and there's no reason to believe otherwise, it's likely to become an unmanageable mess primarily used for promoting companies.
Can this noticeboard be improved? A few months after a thread is archived a lot of people forget the COI incident brought up. A few years later (once the editors involved in a particular incident are inactive or forget the details) the institutional knowledge of a specific COI incident is pretty much forgotten.

His son who helped  with the translation was also very fluent.The treaty is not very long at all so a few hours would easily be enough to do a translation .""Hastily "" suggests it was perhaps full of errors, whereas most historians now recognize that Williams was deliberately using the sort of  Maori language that was most frequently in written use -the language of the bible-to explain concepts that no Maori were familiar with. Claudia Orange, our most notable treaty historian, says she is convinced Maori knew and understood what they were signing. Later events showed some Maori wished to change their minds-largely due to the fact that far more Europeans came to NZ than what they had imagined.

I have a somewhat better understanding of the administrator's role in closing {afd}s.
It is not a vote, it is a seeking for consensus; the admin is authorized to make judgement calls; but, in general, if the number of opinions stated in favor of any opinion is less than roughly 70% of the total of those who logged in, then the result should be recorded as no consensus.

In wiki_link we have seven opinions stated  one from an IP user.

3 delete votes, 2 keep votes, 1 merge.  That would be exactly 50% offering an opinion choosing delete.  So, in theory, , the admin who closed the discussion, should have had a good reason to not record the result as keep  no consensus, correct?

The repetition is merely a means of rhetorical emphasis on the part of the Italian politician – which is fine in the context of political language, but devoid of any additional information value for an encyclopedia. The only effect of repeating this rhetorical figure here in our own language would be to give the statement extra loudness – which may seem attractive to you, because you evidently like to trumpet things out to the reader at maximum volume if they are sympathetic to your POV, but that's not the way serious encyclopedia authors write. Literal quotations have a place in good encyclopedic writing only where the details of somebody's wording are of genuine interest and a paraphrase can't render the nature of the utterance adequately. This is clearly not the case here: the Italians said that in their opinion the agreement was valid; there's nothing open to ""misconceptions"" about this very simple proposition.
: The second disadvantage of using the literal quotation in this instance is that cumbersome orthographical error and the ""sic"". The problem is that so far we can only quote the thing second-hand, from two sources that were both written by non-native speakers of English and which may well have copied from each other, so we simply don't know whether the Italian minister produced that orthographical/grammatical error himself or whether it slipped in through the reporting by these intermediate sources. By reproducing the error and marking it with ""sic"", we are effectively claiming the minister produced it, which may very well be a false claim. This is clearly not a satisfactory situation, but it is extremely easy to avoid, by simply doing what responsible encyclopedic writing would prefer to do anyway: paraphrase.",Future Perfect at Sunrise,763331394.8705.8705,0.0678031099175268,Normal,763331394.8705.8705,780665688.15302.15302,True,True,True,2018,test,2017-02-02 22:40:06,22,3,Evening,True,False,1.0

Also, it is relevant because this relates to a combatant in the conflict, and linking allows both the articles to develop.

I am perplexed that you should re-add the entire 'See also' section - whose links to the 47 war, siachen etc. are properly embedded in the article - just so that this one ""trivia"" stub of yours can be linked. Isn't that a tad too much of over stretching? If you want it to be improved then use the right stub tags and request someone to improve it. Simply linking it in the see also section of a war is hardly the right way to improve articles.

The Reason - there seems to be more chapters on further reading / external links / notes and references than there are on the main text of the article.

Thought this might be what you were looking for in your comments about Gus Grissom.
""In January 1963, shortly after the second group of astronauts was selected, the pilots were given specialty assignments in the MSC programs. Grissom, one of the smaller astronauts, was assigned to the Gemini spacecraft. Because of this and his Mercury experience, he was very close to the McDonnell engineers and technicians - so close, in fact that the cockpits of the first three spacecraft were designed around him, giving him the best view of the instrument panel and out the window. The spacecraft was familiarly dubbed the ""GUSMOBILE."" Although Young was only two inches taller, his seat had to be compressed so he could fit into it. Stafford had to have adjustments made on both the seat and hatch to accommodate his six-foot frame. By July 1963, the program office had discovered that 14 of the 16 astronauts could not be fitted into the cabin as designed, and all later cockpits had to be modified.""
(http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4203/ch10-2.htm)
The HBO series ""From Earth to the Moon"" has a scene with Grissom and Deke Slayton in which Slayton infers that Grissom will be the first astronaut to walk on the moon. I would LOVE to find out if that is just fiction. It does make sense; one of the orginal 7, and flew on Mercury, Gemini and Apollo.

:::Your own talk page gives you away.  external_link, and then adjusted it to another that you think will be believed by most other administrators (as indeed it might).  The term “libel” is not particularly legal; it will endure if-and-when freedom of speech really triumphs.  The person who got over-heated here was you, which is why you were calling me a “dick”, describing my complaint as “bitching”, and telling others to “fuck off”.  Such behavior by an administrator is far mare unhelpful'' to the production of a scholarly project than any mere unwillingness to concede this-or-that point of orthography. —",SlamDiego,98463793.2187.2187,0.6094272416696982,Personal Attack,98463793.2187.2187,97899746.2042.2042,True,True,True,2018,train,2007-01-04 20:46:45,20,3,Evening,False,True,2.0
